# Majestik: 12 Realms

**A narrative-rich, esoteric isekai RPG adventure built in Unreal Engine 5.5+ powered by ESRPG v5.**

---

## Overview

*Majestik: 12 Realms* is a surreal, mystical journey where players embody a "Starchild"â€”a cosmic outsider drawn into a realm governed by metaphysical principles and powerful archetypes. Traverse twelve unique Realms, each representing a facet of consciousness and universal truths, and uncover the secrets of the Architects, the Twin Moons Lux and Nox, and the enigmatic prophecy of Ascension.

This project leverages [Easy Survival RPG v5 (ESRPGv5)] for advanced multiplayer RPG systems and includes custom extensions for lore, esoteric gameplay, procedural systems, and stylized interaction mechanics.

## Developer Notes

### Memory Optimization (Block Asset Load from ESRPG default)
- Use soft references in `DT_Items` to reduce memory bloat.
- Employ async loading (e.g., `LoadSkeletalMeshAsync`) where possible.
- Custom asset loader via C++ recommended for larger modular asset sets.

### Strategy Systems (See `ESRPG Dev Tips and Plans.pdf`)
- LP/Minimax-based AI dynamic behavior
- Real-time difficulty balancing through dual LP solvers
- Trading system built as a zero-sum payoff matrix

### Lore System
- Dynamic quest branching and cosmic mystery logic
- Faction-based narrative trees (e.g., Order of Eternal Flame vs. Enlightened Order)
- Thematic consistency rooted in esoteric traditions and metaphysics
