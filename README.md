Minecraft-Inspired Unreal Engine (UE 5.2) Project with VRM metaverse & Isekai RPG Story Elements

Description

This project is an enterprising attempt to create a Minecraft-esque game using Unreal Engine 5.2+, enhanced with VRM-based player creation (via Vroid Studio in Demo) and presenting strong Isekai RPG elements for an immersive story. Drawing inspiration from the blocky world of Minecraft and the captivating common narratives of popular Isekai manga/anime, this project aims to combine the best of voxel-based sandbox gameplay with immersive RPG storytelling and the power of Unreal Engine. As of right now, this project is mainly done in Blueprints, with supporting elements in C++, for current iterative builds - as I am presently solodev for my studio. Will be incorporating Verse and C++ where applicable in the future. Features are heavily based on Mordern RPG template from Unreal Marketplace, with custom coding and blueprints for a magic system, magic independent leveling system, spellbook with UI (data table driven), survival aspects (dynamic health/stamina/mana directly tied to player status and skills), as well as basic VFX/Animation/SFX for basic elemental spells. Use of Endless Worlds plugin or Voxel procedural generation tools are next for implementaion. I am open to turning this into a group or community project if beneficial.

Features:

  -Voxel-based terrain generation
  
  -Dynamic day-night cycle, survival elements (changes to player status like food and water, stamina regen, and mana effects are all intertwined.)
  
  -Crafting (ammo+survival items) and building mechanics ("Fortnite" style central hub based building currently, but looking to refine and adapt to more suitable methods.)
  
  -Multiplayer support (fully replicated currently.)
  
  -VRM-based player creation: Customize your avatar using the VRM standard, ensuring a unique and personalized gaming experience.
  
  -Isekai RPG Elements: Dive into a rich storyline, complete quests, and interact with unique characters in a world inspired by popular   Isekai manga that incorporates community world building for unique gameplay.
  
  -Advanced AI driven innovation for NPCs, and content generation (diagloge, and economic interactions initially planned), with localhost LLM experiments currently in progress.
